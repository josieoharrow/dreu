## About Me
I am a junior mathematics major at Oregon State University Honors College. I enjoy theoretical computer science and math problems, as well as spending time outdoors and crafting.

## About My Mentor

Theresa Migler is a professor at CalPoly SLO. She works on graph theory projects and other theoretical computer science problems, and likes to go hiking. https://theresamigler.com/

## About My Project

This summer I am working with Dr. Migler and two students at CalPoly (Pranshul and Jonathan) to turn the original 21 NP-complete tree from Karp into a complete cycle, without using the assumption that SAT is NP-Complete. This involves reducing a lot of the problems into other ones.
